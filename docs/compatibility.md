# Compatibility and evidence

## Supported surface

| Area | Status |
| --- | --- |
| Python | CPython 3.9 through 3.13 |
| Operating systems | macOS and Linux target |
| Prompt hooks | Codex CLI, Claude Code, and GitHub Copilot CLI |
| Tool hooks | Claude Code `PreToolUse` and `PostToolUse` only |
| `shim watch` | Claude Code verified; Codex available with an unverified-proxy warning; Copilot out of scope because a custom endpoint removes GitHub authentication |

Codex and Copilot install prompt hooks only. The repository contains no
Codex, Copilot, `PostToolUseFailure`, or `PostToolBatch` tool adapter. Tool
coverage is based on live protocol evidence rather than documentation and is
printed by `shim doctor <client>`.

The local integrations follow the client-native protocol references: the
[Codex hook documentation](https://developers.openai.com/codex/hooks/), Claude
Code [hooks](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/hooks) and
[settings](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/settings), and GitHub's
[Copilot hooks reference](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/reference/hooks-reference).
Codex leaves inline `config.toml` hooks untouched. Claude uses shell-free
arguments and native structured tool responses. Copilot uses
`userPromptTransformed` to replace the model-facing prompt; the original can
remain visible in its timeline.

## Dated development evidence

These facts guided implementation. They are not evidence for the 0.2.0 tag and
must not be copied into its release record without a fresh run.

| Evidence | Recorded result |
| --- | --- |
| Locally inspected prompt clients | Codex CLI 0.149.0, Claude Code 2.1.251, GitHub Copilot CLI 1.0.80 |
| Claude tool protocol probe | Claude Code 2.1.250 on 29 August 2026; 71 sanitised fixtures from seven events |
| Interactive prompt clients | Codex ChatGPT sign-in, Claude first-party sign-in, and GitHub Copilot OAuth exercised on macOS 26.5.2 arm64 |
| Hook activation and timeout behavior | Hooks reviewed and activated; safe and finding prompts exercised; forced timeout or error observed to fail open at the client boundary |
| `shim watch` | Claude verified end to end on 30 August 2026 against a live subscription sign-in; request forwarded unchanged, streaming preserved, and provider usage read from the wire |

The native Claude capture and the decisions made from it are preserved in the
[August 2026 probe](probe-2026-08.md). Repository fixtures contract the prompt
shape for all three clients and the two installed Claude tool-event shapes.

## Detector migration evidence

The evaluation unit is exact output, not category presence. The old
`guard-v1` corpus asserted only category sets, so a finding at the wrong offset
could pass. It has been superseded by:

| Corpus | Cases | Contract |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| `guard-v2.json` | 53 | Exact redacted output for every case, plus source spans for normalization-sensitive cases. |
| `guard-tools-v1.json` | 24 | Exact output at 25 scanned paths in captured tool payloads, per event and policy direction. |
| `parity-v1.json` | 475 | Exact findings, spans, scores, and redacted output from the previous Presidio implementation. |

Of the 475 parity cases, 473 remain byte-identical. The two intentional
differences are `0.0.0.0` and `::1`, which identify no person or remote host and
whose masking erased a meaningful bind-address distinction. Both live in
`DELIBERATE_DIVERGENCES` with reasons and tightly pinned new output. The parity
corpus is generated migration evidence and must never be regenerated to make a
test pass.

The fixture-bound metrics report 100% synthetic precision, recall, and exact
output. That is deterministic contract evidence, not a real-world statistical
guarantee. Every implementation category has a positive and a targeted safe
negative, and the secret-assignment rule has prose negatives.

The detector is first-party and offline. `presidio-analyzer`, its spaCy
pipeline, and `tldextract` were removed; recognizers, checksums, and the public
suffix table are shipped in the package. `phonenumbers` is the one third-party
module on the hook path, enforced by the import contract.

## Historical performance evidence

Before the 0.2.0 release, 20 safe and 20 blocking fresh-process invocations of
the installed package were alternated without warm-up on Darwin 25.4.0 arm64,
macOS 26.4, and CPython 3.13.5:

| Fixture | p50 | p95 | Maximum |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Safe prompt | 63 ms | 66 ms | 67 ms |
| Email block | 64 ms | 67 ms | 69 ms |

Earlier hook-path measurements were:

| Hook path | Interpreter | p50 |
| --- | --- | ---: |
| Installed package | CPython 3.13 | 55–70 ms |
| Bundled `shim.pyz` | CPython 3.13 | about 110 ms |
| Bundled `shim.pyz` | macOS system CPython 3.9.6 | about 205–280 ms |
| Nothing runnable, allow and warn | — | about 6 ms |

The previous Presidio-based implementation measured p50 2,410 ms and p95
4,262 ms on the same development line. Host load dominates these figures, so
they are historical comparisons rather than a release guarantee. Detector
analysis has a 20-second deadline, the outer hook has a 25-second deadline, and
client settings use 30 seconds.

## 0.2.0 release evidence gate

PENDING_RELEASE_EVIDENCE

The marker above deliberately blocks publication. Remove it only after the
release candidate has fresh interactive evidence; CI fixtures cannot establish
authentication, hook trust, or client-controlled timeout behavior.

| Required evidence | 0.2.0 value |
| --- | --- |
| Supported client versions and platform | Pending fresh release-candidate runs |
| Authentication routes | Pending fresh release-candidate runs |
| Trusted-hook activation | Pending fresh release-candidate runs |
| Safe, finding, timeout, and error behavior | Pending fresh release-candidate runs |
| Synthetic corpus and quality metrics | `guard-v2`, `guard-v2-metrics.json`, and `guard-tools-v1.json` |
| Fresh-process latency | `benchmark-hook.json`, generated from the tag |

Repository settings must protect `v*` tags and require reviewers for the
`release` and `pypi` environments; workflow code cannot enforce those
GitHub-side controls.

The tag workflow builds and tests the wheel and source distribution, then
builds the tagged source again on a separate runner and requires byte-identical
artifacts. It generates the plugin archive, locked runtime requirements,
benchmark, hashes, SBOM, and attestations. Release assets also include the
detector corpora and this compatibility record. These checks remain redundant
because they protect different trust boundaries.

The release record must agree with [the 0.2.0 release notes](releases/0.2.0.md),
package and plugin versions, the lock, the committed plugin archive, and the
tag name before the evidence marker is removed.
