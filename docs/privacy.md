# Privacy and trust boundary

## What this does and does not prevent

**With the default configuration, shim Guard does not prevent a secret typed
into a prompt from reaching the model.** It detects the value, reports what it
found, and lets the prompt through. This is a consequence of the hook APIs:
no supported client offers a field for rewriting a submitted prompt, so the
only available alternative is refusing the sentence the user just typed. That
is the most disruptive thing this product can do, and it is opt-in
(`user-prompt = "enforce"`).

What the default configuration *does* prevent is local data entering the
model's context through tool results — a file read, a grep, command output, an
MCP response. Those are masked in place before the model sees them, which is
where most leakage actually happens.

Three things follow, and all three are limits rather than features:

- Masking an outbound tool argument is **egress control**, not model
  protection. The model produced that argument, so it has already seen the
  value; masking stops it leaving the machine.
- `Bash` commands and `Write`/`Edit` content are **never rewritten**. Editing a
  command changes what runs, and editing a write payload puts a placeholder
  into a real file. Both are detected and can be warned about or denied.
- Files referenced with `@` bypass hooks entirely, so nothing here sees them.

## Data flow

```text
client prompt -> trusted shim hook -> in-memory offline detector
             <- empty success | Copilot model-facing typed rewrite
                              | native stop response with categories and file path
                                                        |
                                                        -> 0600 typed redaction
```

The hook reads the submitted-prompt fields needed for the native contract. It
does not send prompt data to shim and does not create a replacement map. It
does keep a record of its own decisions, described under **What is recorded**
below; that record holds entity names and counts and never the values.
Safe input produces exactly empty stdout and stderr. For a supported Copilot
finding, the hook returns the typed redaction as the model-facing replacement
and writes no file. For Codex and Claude Code, it writes one typed redaction to
a `0600` file in the operating system's temporary directory and returns a
tested native block containing its absolute path in a ready-to-copy instruction
to use the file contents as the prompt. A handled hook error returns the
client's generic fail-closed response and leaves no suggestion file. The raw
prompt and detected raw values are not written by shim.

The temporary redaction remains until the user deletes it or the operating
system cleans temporary storage. It can still contain sensitive content the
detector missed, so users must review it before resubmission and delete it when
finished.

Users may enable or disable public entity types with `shim config`. The default
preset enables all supported types. The local settings file contains entity
names only. An invalid or unsafe settings file causes the hook to return its
generic fail-closed response rather than silently ignoring the policy.

Where a checksum exists it is verified, so a mistyped IBAN or Turkish national
ID is not reported. Detection also stays deliberately quiet on values that name
nobody: the loopback and unspecified addresses (`127.0.0.1`, `0.0.0.0`, `::1`)
and connection strings to them that carry no credentials. Private ranges, real
hosts, and any URI with a `user:password@` are still detected. This is a
precision choice with a cost attached — a `10.x` address that really is
internal topology is still masked, and the exemption is written narrowly so it
can never be a way to smuggle a credential past.

## What is recorded

shim keeps a record of what it did, so that a tool which is silent when it
succeeds can still show its work. The rule for its contents is absolute: **no
entry ever holds payload text.** Entity names and counts, yes; the value that
produced them, never. A file path or URL is kept because it is what makes the
summary useful, and it is run through the detector first, so a secret inside a
path is masked there too. A shell command is never kept at all — a command is
payload, and the probe corpus contains one carrying a live credential.

One entry per decision:

```json
{"ts": "2026-08-29T14:51:06Z", "session_id": "…", "client": "claude",
 "event": "PostToolUse", "tool_name": "Read", "target": "/work/service/.env",
 "direction": "inbound", "mode": "enforce", "action": "mask",
 "entities": {"SECRET": 2}, "latency_ms": 7, "in_bytes": 812, "out_bytes": 806}
```

### While a session is open

Hooks are separate processes, so the record cannot live in memory across
events. It is a file per session under the operating system's temporary
directory, in a directory owned by you and readable by nobody else (`0700`,
with `0600` files). shim refuses to use that directory if it finds it readable
by other users, and `shim doctor` reports when that has happened — recording
never breaks the guard, so without that check the failure would be silent.

**The session file is deleted at `SessionEnd`**, when the client closes. It is
capped at 1 MB; past that the summary undercounts and says so.

`shim report` prints the most recent session's summary. The same summary is
shown inside the client at the end of any turn where something changed.

Because the session file is deleted when the client closes, `shim report` has
nothing to read afterwards unless the ledger below is on. When it is, the
report falls back to the newest retained session and says that is where the
numbers came from.

### Past the end of a session — off by default

`shim config --ledger` opts in to keeping the same records after the session
ends. It is off unless you turn it on, and `shim config --no-ledger` turns it
back off. Files live under `$XDG_STATE_HOME/shim-guard` (or
`~/.local/state/shim-guard`), one per month, `0600`, capped at 5 MB each.

Retention is 30 days, enforced by deleting whole months. The exact promise is
therefore: **a month's records are deleted 30 days after the end of that
month** — so an entry written on the first of a month outlives one written on
the last by up to the length of the month. Age is taken from the file's name,
not its modification time, so restoring a backup or touching a file does not
extend it. `shim ledger purge` deletes everything immediately.

Retention is enforced when a record is written. Turning the ledger off stops
new records but does not expire the ones already kept; `shim ledger purge`
does that at once.

Nothing here is ever transmitted. There is no telemetry, no account, and no
network call anywhere in shim.

### When shim cannot inspect something

Some payloads are refused rather than scanned: a tool result past the size
bound, or an analysis that fails. What happens next depends on which side it
is, and the asymmetry is deliberate.

On a **prompt**, shim fails closed. The prompt is withheld and the message
names `shim doctor`, because the usual cause is a settings file that will not
parse, and that blocks every prompt of the session until it is fixed.

On a **tool event**, shim fails open: the result already exists, so refusing it
destroys the user's work while protecting nothing. The payload is passed
through **unchanged and unmasked**, the client is told so, and — the part that
matters here — it is written to the session record and appears in the summary
as `skipped … not inspected, passed through`. Failing open is a considered
trade; failing open silently is not, because a clean-looking summary would then
stand for a payload shim never examined.

## What is changed on the way in

Besides masking, shim compacts tool results so they take less of the model's
context. Every transform is deterministic and idempotent, because the
provider's prompt cache only hits if the history is byte-identical on every
request, so a transform that drifts costs money instead of saving it.

Two transforms ship, both enabled by default. `json` is lossless. `whitespace`
is not, and the difference is worth stating plainly: it strips trailing spaces
and tabs from the end of every line, which is invisible in almost all text but
removes a Markdown hard line break, since that break *is* two trailing spaces.
It never changes a line count. `diet = ["json"]` keeps only the lossless one.

JSON is compacted by a lexer rather than by parsing and re-serialising:
re-serialising rewrites number literals (`1.10` becomes `1.1`, a long decimal
loses digits to a float) and drops duplicate keys, which changes what the model
reads. Only the whitespace between tokens is removed. Line-numbered results
keep their line count, so blank lines are never collapsed. Nothing is ever
truncated or summarised.

Diet applies to tool **results** only — never a tool's arguments, never a local
write, and never under `mode = "observe"`. It also stops at any result that is
a *view of a file*: the model reproduces those bytes to edit the file, and
`Edit` matches `old_string` against what is on disk rather than against what
the model was shown, so reshaping a file on the way in makes the next edit of
it miss. `shim config --no-diet` turns it off; `diet = ["json"]` in the config
file selects individual transforms.

shim also flags text in a result that reads as an instruction to the model.
Invisible-character detection covers the zero-width space, the invisible
operators, the bidi *overrides* behind Trojan Source, and the Unicode tag block
used to smuggle whole instructions past a human reviewer. It deliberately
ignores characters that render as nothing but have ordinary uses — the byte
order mark, the zero-width joiner inside emoji, the zero-width non-joiner that
Persian and Hindi orthography require, and the plain bidi marks — because a
marker the user learns to ignore protects nobody.

Those markers are **reported and never acted upon**, and they are not entities:
no setting can turn one into a rewrite, because rewriting a result for looking
imperative would corrupt legitimate content — a code review, a style guide, or
documentation about prompt injection.

## Outside shim's boundary

The host client receives the raw prompt. Matching hooks can start concurrently,
so shim cannot stop another matching hook from receiving it. Clients,
operating-system tools, plugins, and providers can retain logs, transcripts,
telemetry, caches, or history independently of shim.

Copilot's `userPromptTransformed` replacement changes what is sent to the model
and stored in session history, but the original prompt can remain visible in
Copilot's timeline.

Some clients require review and trust for non-managed hooks. A hook can be
disabled, untrusted after a change, missing, unable to start, crash, or time
out; those outcomes are client-controlled and may fail open. shim does not
promise detection of every value, inspect automatic context, or securely erase
Python process memory. Tool inputs and tool results *are* inspected, at the
events listed by `shim doctor <client>`; anything reaching the model by another
route is outside that list.

Installer checks detect unsafe paths and observed drift, but they are not an
isolation boundary against a malicious process already running as the same OS
user. Such a process has equivalent authority over user-scoped client settings
and can race POSIX pathname operations despite advisory locking.

Review every temporary redaction before resubmission. The detector can miss
sensitive content.


## `shim watch`

The proxy sees the whole wire body — the system prompt, the tools array, the
full message history and every file the client inlined for an `@` reference.
None of it is kept.

What survives one request is a count and a size: bytes per section, entity
counts by type, a token count from the provider, the model name and the request
path. **No request or response body is ever written to disk**, and
`tests/watch/test_proxy.py` asserts it by sending a unique marker through the
proxy and then searching every file written anywhere beneath the temporary root
for it.

The proxy binds to loopback only. It is forwarding a live credential, and
binding to anything reachable would hand that credential to the network. It
lives for the length of one `shim watch` command, edits no shell profile, and
changes no setting; the client is given a base URL in its own environment and
nothing else.

Nothing is transmitted anywhere except to the provider the client was already
talking to. There is still no telemetry and no account.
